# study_toolkit

This is (a work in progress) study project designed to allow for creating tree diagrams from the CLI.
The goal is to get the tool to be a standalone means of studying text-based note material, all from the CLI.
The tree diagrams are what I find most useful, and the rest of the toolkit was inspired by Ali Abdaal's
youtube video on "How to study for exams - The Retrospective Revision Timetable".

As of now:
  It can be used for making multi-tier tree diagrams and is especially useful for quick, organized note-taking. 
  The program allows for creating flashcards as well.
  The program allows for saving trees and flashcard sets as csv files and importing csv files as trees or flashcards.

Other functionality that may appear as an option in the menu but hasn't been added in yet includes but is not limited to:
  Revision timetables.
  Slicing data from a tree or flashcard set and importing it into revision timetable.
  Slicing data from the tree and importing it into flashcards.

Other functionality that may be added:
  Further display/output filtering and formatting.
